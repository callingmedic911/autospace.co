<p>The second act is called “<strong>The Turn</strong>”. <del>The magician</del> Koenigsegg takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary.</p>

</div>
<div>But you wouldn&#8217;t clap yet&#8230;</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<div>The last we saw of Christian Koenigsegg or any of his magic tricks was the Hundra. Oh no, wait he left us with some video series giving an insight in to his establishment.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bch5B23_pu0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I suddenly felt there were a lot of similarities between Koenigsegg’s story so far and the opening dialogue of Michael Caine&#8217;s in Christopher Nolan’s “The Prestige”. It’s as if Mr. Koenigsegg appeared into the automotive industry through the mysterious exhaust fumes of a swedish classic (maybe a Volvo P1800) conjuring super cars who’s cockpit seems to have been inspired by the shape of his head. His magic spread quickly through the industry and suddenly Sweden had a serious automotive contender other than Volvo. He enjoyed million dollar success in a very short time and no body has been able to learn the tricks of his trade yet. All of this seems even more suspicious when you realise that Christian has had no engineering background. NONE.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<div>No one had heard from him or his small work force since the last launch of the Hundra. The automotive industry has seen many such small-timers who have basked in the short lived success story until bankruptcy or the environmentalists intrude their party (Read- Titania, Fisker, Intermeccanica, Iso). So no one took this company as seriously as we were suppose to be.</div>
</div>
<div>
<div id="attachment_5116" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ksegg-factory.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5116" class="size-medium wp-image-5116" src="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ksegg-factory-300x200.jpg" alt="Awfully quite around this place. Not for long!" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ksegg-factory-300x200.jpg 300w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ksegg-factory-1024x682.jpg 1024w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ksegg-factory-374x249.jpg 374w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ksegg-factory-800x533.jpg 800w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ksegg-factory.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-5116" class="wp-caption-text">Awfully quite around this place. Not for long!</p></div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But what Mr. Koenigsegg has come out with this time shows that he MEANS business. He’s back to prove a point, just like every other magician. That’s why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call “The Prestige”.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Welcome ladies and gentleman to the Koenigsegg One:1.</div>
<div></div>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ud7drmR2wJ8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<div>Continuing the analogy of Mr. Koenigsegg’s new car launch with “The Prestige”, things seem even more fitting now when we look under the spirit of the ghost. The dispute between magicians and wizards (as shown in the movie too) is clearly visible through Koenigsegg’s work also and being the magician that he is, has completely disregarded Nikola Tesla&#8217;s electric motors. So what we have is <em>only</em> a turbocharged 5L V8 producing two numbers i never thought could exist mutually- Power output of 1360 bhp and torque is a staggering 1000Nm! Thousand! Somewhere right now, AMG engineers feel a cold shiver.</p>
<div id="attachment_5117" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1913296_10202530831126309_2076721666_o.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5117" class="size-medium wp-image-5117" src="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1913296_10202530831126309_2076721666_o-300x200.jpg" alt="Power of the Ghost" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1913296_10202530831126309_2076721666_o-300x200.jpg 300w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1913296_10202530831126309_2076721666_o-1024x684.jpg 1024w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1913296_10202530831126309_2076721666_o-374x250.jpg 374w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1913296_10202530831126309_2076721666_o-800x534.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-5117" class="wp-caption-text">Power of the Ghost</p></div>
</div>
<div>So for those who think the One:1 is a hasty reply to the LaFerrari, P1 or Porsche 918, you’re completely wrong because that’s like comparing apples to oranges. The One:1 produces 1 MEGAWATT of power. A Full MEGAWATT! That’s enough energy to power a THOUSAND homes. A moment of silence then for the wannabe Henessey Venom that recently got its pants wet in the excitement of breaking the record for the fastest production car.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The name of this Swede may not be as radical as the car itself, but it’s has a fundamental meaning to it. The power to weight ratio of the Koenigsegg is a bang on 1:1. Mind you the weight considered here is the kerb weight which includes weight of all the fluids and half the fuel tank. Yes I have heard enough rants about the fact that the Caparo T1 has achieved a similar feat but seriously, between a Koenigsegg and a Caparo which would you really choose?</p>
</div>
<div>For a very long time now I have been watching the progress of the 3D printers closely and I can honestly say I’m quite a strong supporter of this breakthrough rapid prototyping technology. Formula SAE cars, the <b><a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/news/industry/urbee-2-the-3d-printed-car-that-will-drive-across-the-country-16119485">Urbee</a> </b> concept and many more are just humble examples of the this technology creeping into the automotive  industry. Koenigsegg has incorporated Variable Geometry Turbocharger( VGT) and Titanium exhausts, both of which are 3D printed. This gives Koenigsegg unlimited freedom to develop optimised turbine blade designs and at much lower costs.</p>
<div id="attachment_5119" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/3d-printed-exhaust-.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5119" class="size-medium wp-image-5119" src="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/3d-printed-exhaust--300x169.jpg" alt="Printable Titanium Exhaust" width="300" height="169" srcset="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/3d-printed-exhaust--300x169.jpg 300w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/3d-printed-exhaust--374x210.jpg 374w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/3d-printed-exhaust-.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-5119" class="wp-caption-text">Printable Titanium Exhaust</p></div>
</div>
<div>Active Aerodynamics on this Koenigsegg is the first ever for Christian and he’s taken enough time to learn from the best to make it even better. But since my air flow studies have been limited to only farting and occasional kite flying, I decided to seek help from an expert. Certainly my aerodynamics knowledge hasn’t improved but the rendering is surely a jaw dropper. So much detailing. Kudos to<em> Shweta Rawat</em> for this.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Koenigsegg is loaded with all kinds of maniacal technologies and what is described here is only the tip of the iceberg. The internet isn’t short of explaining the rest but what I want to focus on here is an emotional and philosophical side to it all.</div>
<div>
<div id="attachment_5120" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/rawat2a.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5120" class="size-medium wp-image-5120" src="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/rawat2a-300x225.jpg" alt="© Shweta Rawat " width="300" height="225" srcset="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/rawat2a-300x225.jpg 300w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/rawat2a-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/rawat2a-374x281.jpg 374w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/rawat2a-800x600.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-5120" class="wp-caption-text">© Shweta Rawat</p></div>
</div>
<div>
The great wizard and soothsayer, Tesla once said “Society tolerates only one change at a time”. He’s right. With the likes of LaFerrari, BMW i8, P1 and 918 Spyder, a new era of hybrid supercars has already begun. Along with this and the birth of Formula E, buyers and enthusiasts are forced to be conscious of their carbon footprints without wanting to compromise on the madness that associates with such cars. So the wold is almost convinced that electric power is the near and realistic future of the automotive industry. This takes a lot of effort for us petrolheads to accept this change.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Now Mr. Koenigsegg, the magician, is not making the change easy on us one bit as he has pushed the barriers of IC engine technology (272 bhp/litre), suspension system (carbon push rods),  manufacturing (3D printed exhausts) and driver to car connectivity (customised mobile app for various control settings and the great GPS feature). With all this all-rounded technological breakthroughs, I wonder when his proven cam-less engine concept is going to be implemented and what other tricks the magician may have up his sleeve.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>But I fear the One:1 may not get the appreciation it deserves. It certainly has stupefied the competitors, but the importance of this car on the technological scale and the future it holds for the industry may be overlooked.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Its probably how Frank Darabont, the director of  <em>The Shawshank Redemption</em>  felt when he didn&#8217;t get the Best Picture Award. But Frank, what did you expect when you released the movie at the same time <em>Forrest Gump</em>, <em>Pulp Fiction</em> and <em>Schindler’s List</em> were released?</div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s that time of the year again when fanciful dreams and reality re-unite. Yes, it’s Christmas time and in all fairness, Piston Claus has yet again made our boyish dreams come true. If you’re wondering who (or what) Piston Claus is, he is an imaginary Santa Claus of the automotive industry whom we like to believe dresses up in a BMW “ M fan” sweatshirt and spongebob boxers, zips around the streets in a tuned GT-R with four V12 AMG engines, delivering automotive gifts to naughty gearheads in the boot of one’s car.</p>
<p>Yes he’s an atheist, despises the Lexus SC, and some say that he’s The Stig’s brother-in-law. All we know is that he has left us Lambophiles with a great deal of satisfaction. Thank you Piston Claus, for the latest Lamborghini, the HURACAN! (Insert lightning storms and bulls stampede here)</p>
<p><b><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduzione:</span></i></b></p>
<p>In the truest tradition of our religion (read Lamborghini), at the launch of a new bull we sacrifice one black horse (preferably in a prancing posture) to our great lord, Ferrucio Lamborghini. This holy tradition that we follow symbolizes the death of one Ferrari for every new Lamborghini that is born in the womb of Modena, only to add fuel (direct injection, of course)<b> </b>to the evident rivalry between the two.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">So what do we get on first look: Audi’s persistent complaint about polishing the sharp cuts in Lambo’s body panels seems to be slowly taking effect as can be seen in the new Huracan. After you feel and absorb every angle of the car through that desktop screen, you can sense a beautiful mix of the designs of their past concepts and production vehicles. The rear has a strong oomph of the Sesto Elemento, the front headlights and fenders remind us of the Estoque (The bull that never was), the stance of an Aventador. Although the two humble creases on the front bonnet remind us of the yester years of the Gallardo family, showcasing that the Huracan family will proudly carry on the legacy of it’s past.</span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tech Analysis-</span> </i></b><i>More than meets the eye:</i></p>
<p>The Huracan’s design may be a hybrid of many Lambos, but the heart remains the same. Powered by a 5.2L V10, the same as the last Gallardo except more powerful. Power has escalated to a minor yet progressive increment of 610bhp. But don’t be ignorant of what this means because after running down a few calculations of my own, it turns out that the Huracan’s specific power output of 117.307hp/L is the highest for any naturally aspirated V10 engine EVER MADE. What this means is that the conventional trend of engine downsizing to increase specific power output is disregarded by the Italians as they continue to maintain the beautifully honed engine volume of 5204cc. <b></b></p>
<div id="attachment_5107" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/inside-huracan.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5107" class="size-medium wp-image-5107" src="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/inside-huracan-300x198.jpg" alt="Inside the Huracan!" width="300" height="198" srcset="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/inside-huracan-300x198.jpg 300w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/inside-huracan-374x247.jpg 374w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/inside-huracan.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-5107" class="wp-caption-text">Inside the Huracan!</p></div>
<p>No details about the full specifications yet but Lambo claim a 0-60 stint in 3.2s. Kerb weight is down to 1422kg– a figure that has made Piston Claus awkwardly conscious. Chassis is a hybrid of Carbon fiber and Aluminium and the engine is coupled to the ‘box via dual-clutches. Torque reads a mountainous 560Nm at 6500rpm. Carbon Ceramic disc brakes come as standard. The wheels are no wind-sucking-to-cool-the-discs type crazy, but a practical 5 spoke Aluminum 19”.  Front windshield is more inclined almost like the Super Trofeo Stradale version. From what can be seen, it looks like the rear track width is lesser than that of the front. That is surely uncalled for by a Lambo but will prove advantageous in terms of handling. The three driving modes of Strada, Sport, and Corsa are also included.</p>
<div id="attachment_5108" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/huracan-interior-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5108" class="size-medium wp-image-5108" src="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/huracan-interior-1-300x199.jpg" alt="Hexagonal fest!" width="300" height="199" srcset="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/huracan-interior-1-300x199.jpg 300w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/huracan-interior-1-374x248.jpg 374w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/huracan-interior-1.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-5108" class="wp-caption-text">Hexagonal fest!</p></div>
<p>This brings me to the interior of the car- The center dash buttons can be commonly mistaken for launching nuke missiles. Like Mercedes’ classic cross shaped air vents (emphatically seen in the SLS), Lambo have a striking and cheeky hexagon tubed air-con vents. Almost seems like carbon nano tubes came to reality. Even at the head of the glove box, the angular hexagonal faces are taken from the rear grill of the Egoista. One look at the instrument cluster panel housing will assure you that it’s giving BMW’s i8 a run for it’s money.

<a href="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/huracan-2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5109" src="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/huracan-2-300x195.jpg" alt="huracan-2" width="300" height="195" srcset="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/huracan-2-300x195.jpg 300w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/huracan-2-374x243.jpg 374w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/huracan-2.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a> With the name as striking as the new Lambo itself, the origin of it is interpreted  differently. The general Spanish speaking peeps say it means “hurricane”, but ask a  Spanish historian and he/she would tell you that it was a legendary animal (part  human, part bull) that fought gallantly in Alicante, Spain in 1879. We assume this  to be the closest reason for such a name, and it&#8217;s not too hard to pronounce either  now that we&#8217;ve exercised our cheek muscles trying to get the Pagani Huayra right.</p>
<p>Over the years, as hardcore Lambophiles, we have witnessed the beautiful  evolution and growth of the company and as true enthusiasts we almost feel part of  this family.</p>
<p>The video series made OFFICIALLY by Lamborghini as a teaser proves a point- that they have not only made boys of all ages wet their beds, but have acknowledged the compelling passion of true Lambo fans. Watch the video and all it’s parts to understand what I mean.</p>

<p>As a way of giving back something to this beautiful company, my wingman <em>Soumya Kanta Das,</em> who’s an ace automotive designer (self-taught), has rendered the Huracan Spyder version already, a move that Lambo would naturally consider in the near future. Mind you, he did this in <i>exactly one hour! </i>So Mr.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephan_Winkelmann" target="_blank"><b>Stephan Winkelmann</b></a>, if you’re reading this, you know whom to hire next.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Finale:</strong></span></em></p>
<p>Before we end this Italian drama here, we got to admit- there’s a lot of room for improvement. Lamborghini’s first models are similar to Android phones- once you have it, there’s much that can be experimented with. It even takes a while to accept and realize how beautifully refined this new Lamborghini really is, given the fact that the last two launches (The Veneno and <a title="Lamborghini Egoista: History Repeats Itself!" href="http://autospace.co/lamborghini-egoista-history-repeats-itself/" target="_blank"><b>Egoista</b></a>) were just outright mental.</p>
<p>But when you look at it over and over again, you are filled with a sense of inner peace knowing that Lamborghini not only gave the Gallardo family a fitting end but also justified its successor. <i>It’s as if Vito Corleone handed over the mafia family to Michael Corleone knowing he would be the perfect heir.</i> Once again, Lamborghini has the last word.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Today&#8217;s</strong></span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Topic</span>:</strong> Google haven&#8217;t done their <em>homework. </em></p>
<p>A small company from Cheshire, UK that was started by the Briggs bros. believes in a small and efficient working force. So it took a team just of 8 people to build the radical BAC Mono. With only a brief glance, other cars would WOW and believe that this is what future holds for them.<br />
So in the unlikely moment of your busy life you may ask yourself- How many Google workers does it take to make a car? Well it&#8217;s 15 apparently. Seven more than BAC and yet you can&#8217;t even drive it.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m shedding light on what is more of a bottled up frustration in petrol heads like us- the birth of autonomous vehicles or better known as &#8220;driverless&#8221; cars. This epiphany could be a controversial one and I sense some abuses and counter arguments being thrown at me by the end of this read, but I&#8217;d like to take my chances here.</p>
<p>With technology always on the rise, I understand that this is certainly a hoorah moment for Google&#8217;s computer geeks and programmers who can feel proud of running a car for 300,000 miles (without crashing) by just few lines of coding. But there is a question that the automotive world is asking and nobody seems to be paying attention- Is there really a need for such a technology? Watch the video below to know Google&#8217;s skunk works.</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cdgQpa1pUUE?start=38&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>For almost 40 years and more now the environmental agencies and local tree huggers have been pointing fingers at the auto industry for being one of the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions. And since then cars have been compromised on all sorts of other things just to pollute lesser. Car bodies being more slippery for lesser drag and hence lesser fuel consumption, composite materials to reduce weight, infinite iterations on engine design, fuel metering systems and changes in fuel composition itself; if you pick up a magazine, you&#8217;ll be convinced that we (the automotive industry) have almost perfected this world and that we&#8217;re only going to get better at it.<br />
So how <em>exactly </em>is Google planning to appease UNEP, IPCC, WNO etc. by making a <strong>driverless</strong> car?</p>
<p>Firstly, lets throw our fears out. I&#8217;m not doubting the abilities of Google, but then I&#8217;d never want to let a computer control all the driving functions of my car and run it in &#8220;autopilot&#8221; mode. The last time I let computers take control of my life, I almost ignored a small earthquake just so I could finish first in this racing game called POD. Looking at the aerospace industry and how they haven&#8217;t been hasty about having self flying passenger planes is something truly to be appreciative of their progressive approach towards perfection.</p>
<blockquote><p>Our automated cars use video cameras, radar sensors and a laser range finder to &#8216;see&#8217; other traffic, as well as detailed maps to navigate the road ahead.</p></blockquote>
<p>On Google&#8217;s official blog it is mentioned so. Google also mentions that about 750MB of data is analysed and collected by the on-board computers every second. Such heavy dependence on these wired friends makes me wonder if Google have considered what would happen if their car is subjected to a large Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) field. All the brains of the car would seize at quickest moment bringing the car to a &#8220;ctrl-alt-del&#8221; moment.</p>
<div id="attachment_5102" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/google_car.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5102" class="size-medium wp-image-5102" src="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/google_car-300x169.jpg" alt="Street view that Google's cars see." width="300" height="169" srcset="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/google_car-300x169.jpg 300w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/google_car-374x210.jpg 374w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/google_car-800x450.jpg 800w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/google_car.jpg 950w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-5102" class="wp-caption-text">Street view that Google&#8217;s cars see.</p></div>
<p>In another feat by Google in trying to explain and impress their technology to the commoners, they recently uploaded the image of what the on-board computer &#8220;sees&#8221; while making a turn. One of the software developers said- &#8220;<em>If it sees a cigarette butt, it knows a person might be creeping out from between cars. If it sees a rolling ball it knows a child might run out from a driveway.&#8221; </em></p>
<p>Making sensors that sensitive and softwares with such complex algorithms is like making the exact same mistake the car industry made decades ago. The best example would be the pressure sensors of air bags and how researchers are trying to &#8220;de-sensitize&#8221; these sensors so that the air bags wouldn&#8217;t blow up in the cabin for the smallest of bumps like when a car tries to mount the curb.</p>
<p>With three of such insignificant incidents discussed above, how then does Google chose to stay true their word about cutting yearly road accidents by as much as HALF with such technology? The more you dwell in this topic, the more it makes you feel that Google decided to adopt a Toyota Prius and just strap some Google equipment without really learning from the pioneers themselves.</p>
<p>Audi with its A7 boasted of an almost convincing video of a self parking car that drops the working man at the lobby, seeks out for a vacant parking spot, hibernates, and at the touch of a button is back in the lobby, ALL BY ITSELF!<br />
But notice closely and you&#8217;ll notice lot of loopholes in this concept &#8211; what if the phone battery dies out and you cant override the code to open your car? What if the closest parking spot that the car finds is at least 7 miles away or worse, what if it can&#8217;t find a parking spot at all and then cause havoc on city streets? What about the heavy battery consumption required to run such electrically dependent auxiliary systems that might drain the charge if parked for too long?<br />
<iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vt20UnkmkLI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
In fact, Mercedes even though they are uber confident about their &#8220;steering assist&#8221; in the 2014 S-Class (Yes, 2014!), which is another name for autopilot mode, emphasised that the autonomous drive (or steering assist) will only work as long as the driver has his <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hands fixed firmly on the steering wheel</span>, and that it cannot tackle turns by itself after a certain speed of 40kmph.</p>
<p><em>All of this should help Google understand the automotive industry&#8217;s progressive approach towards better mobility. Clearly, Google haven&#8217;t done their homework.</em></p>
<p>So dear Google programmers, look through your &#8220;glass&#8221; carefully (pun intended) and understand that automotive technology and mobility should be left in the rightful hands of our people as shown in the image below.</p>
<p><a href="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/megan_fox_repairing_car.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5103" src="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/megan_fox_repairing_car-300x169.jpg" alt="megan_fox_repairing_car" width="300" height="169" srcset="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/megan_fox_repairing_car-300x169.jpg 300w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/megan_fox_repairing_car-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/megan_fox_repairing_car-374x210.jpg 374w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/megan_fox_repairing_car-800x450.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>And if you do chose to continue this project, could you at least choose a less hideous car than the Prius? M4 maybe? I&#8217;m sure that blind man you brought along as your test drive for that driverless Toyota would&#8217;ve loved to <del datetime="2013-08-19T21:50:26+00:00">drive</del> &#8220;feel like driving&#8221; a sexier car than a Prius.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Attention readers! If you haven&#8217;t come across this monstrosity in the &#8220;world wild web&#8221;, don&#8217;t be alarmed. It&#8217;s not a car that you&#8217;d be racing from Mars to Sirius with. It&#8217;s the new Lamborghini launched just too 40 hours ago, and it&#8217;s already CONTROVERSIAL !</p>
<div id="attachment_5092" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/meluta.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5092" class="size-medium wp-image-5092" src="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/meluta-300x161.png" alt="TORO!

TORO!</p></div>
<p>Being a 90&#8217;s kid, I&#8217;ve seen the births of many Lamborghinis right from the Gallardo and all it&#8217;s variants right up to the latest LP570-4, to the Murcielagos and its variants after the first LP640-4 was launched, the Reventon, Aventador, the Aventador J, the Urus etc etc. I remember a week before my 12th birthday I first read an article about &#8220;Lamborghini to hit Indian Shores&#8221; in the local newspapers and have followed the release of these bulls into our already chaotic land right from the start. Yes, at the risk of sounding a complete lunatic, it&#8217;s safe to say that I play Lamborghinis quite close to my chest. And in my last 9 years of lunacy, i must say that this must be the first time I didn&#8217;t wave my Muleta (the red cape used by the Matador) frantically to welcome this new bull in my life.</p>
<p>So I believe there&#8217;s a need to clear some tension that&#8217;s surrounding this new Lamborghini Egoista because there&#8217;s a  lot of negative comments lingering around this car and its not much appreciated. Some say they&#8217;ve gone too far with the &#8220;extremism&#8221; philosophy that Lamborghini is well known for. Others say that maybe the heavy aerospace influence has finally got the best of them and that they&#8217;ve taken the aerodynamic theory of &#8220;cutting through the air&#8221; a bit TOO seriously if you look at the front of it. Others are seriously considering handing the lambo designers a set of &#8220;French curves&#8221; stencils to go easy on the angular cuts that makes you bleed just when you look at them.</p>
<p><em>But if you were born in the 70&#8217;s, then all of this would come to you as a sort of déjà vú, because these were probably the exact same reactions the public gave when the Lamborghini Countach was unveiled back in 1974. History indeed repeats itself.</em></p>
<p>Lets take a step back and first try to understand the technicalities involved with this machine. Designed by Walter De Silva, the design inspiration was taken from an Apache helicopter. Lambo&#8217;s nomenclature department decided not to sacrifice another bull and its lineage to name their new car. They instead referred to the Italian dictionary. The word &#8220;Egoista&#8221; means selfish and it stands true to its word, as it is a single seater cockpit.</p>
<div id="attachment_5093" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/canopy.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5093" class="size-medium wp-image-5093" src="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/canopy-300x204.jpg" alt="Goodbye Scissor doors!" width="300" height="204" srcset="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/canopy-300x204.jpg 300w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/canopy.jpg 301w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-5093" class="wp-caption-text">Goodbye Scissor doors!</p></div>
<p>A brief yet important transition in Lamborghini legacy to replace the already mental scissor doors with a floating canopy. The cockpit is centrally placed and in order to get in it, you need to tenderly place your feet on the appropriate markings and then twist and turn and fold yourself before you see an orange adorned monocell. And the complication doesn&#8217;t end there. Lamborghini have placed only the bare requirements in the little space that you need to detach the steering wheel from its steering column, like that of a formula 1 car, to even fit inside it.</p>
<p>Powered by the Gallardo&#8217;s 5.7L V10 engine, and no other details of the powertrain, one can only pray for mercy. Four projector lamps hidden well within the crevasse of the front slits, some sort of wacky warning lights on the roof, a bare naked rare to reveal the mammoth firepower that has more room now that the passenger is kicked out of the picture. Rumour also has it that the Egoista when viewed from the 3/4th isometric view, seems like a bull poised with its horns low towards the ground. Everything about this car re-defines &#8220;FUTURISM&#8221;.<br />
The most stand out technology that you&#8217;ll notice once you&#8217;re in is the heads-up display.<br />
Lamborghini is so inclined towards fighting with the apaches that the orange tinted cockpit is made up of anti-radar material. Even the orange paint on those not so conventional Lambo wheels are of anti radiation material. What ever that means.</p>
<div id="attachment_5094" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/c2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5094" class="size-full wp-image-5094" src="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/c2.jpg" alt="Centralized cockpit of the Egoista." width="500" height="375" srcset="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/c2.jpg 500w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/c2-300x225.jpg 300w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/c2-374x281.jpg 374w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-5094" class="wp-caption-text">Centralized cockpit of the Egoista.</p></div>
<p>All of this still sounds maddening and thoughts occur that this is how Lamborghinis should continue to exist and that it shouldn&#8217;t be adulterated with the sophistication of those German owners. I still look at the pictures again and again but I&#8217;m still only half convinced. I mean, orange wheels and canopies..Seriously, Lamborghini?</p>
<div id="attachment_5096" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/pagani.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5096" class="wp-image-5096 size-medium" src="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/pagani-300x174.png" alt="Horacio Pagani (first from right) with a developmental Countach" width="300" height="174" srcset="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/pagani-300x174.png 300w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/pagani-374x217.png 374w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/pagani-800x464.png 800w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/pagani.png 880w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-5096" class="wp-caption-text">Horacio Pagani (first from right) with a developmental Countach</p></div>
<p>Last night I was restless and my thoughts were a turbulent one as I was still not able to adjust to this new philosophy, and it was somewhere at 0300 hours while reading about Horacio Pagani that I found my answers. It was Pagani&#8217;s last few years at Lamborghini and some hidden pictures of his concept on the Lamborghini Countach (to celebrate the 25th anniversary) in which I found solace.<br />
To make you understand, you really need to place yourself in the shoes of the current Lamborghini team. It isn&#8217;t a car that is meant to be sold, taken that there will be a lot of buyers, but that isn&#8217;t the point.</p>
<p>It REALLY is the setting in which the car was unveiled that really gives us the answers. They didn&#8217;t choose to unveil it in any of the international  motor shows or even reveal a single hint of this machine. On the LAST DAY OF the epic 4 day celebration of lamborghini&#8217;s 50th anniversary, they chose to reveal it to the world in the comfort of their own home, Sant&#8217; Agata Bolognese, Italy.</p>
<p><a href="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/50.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5097" src="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/50.jpg" alt="50" width="989" height="542" srcset="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/50.jpg 989w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/50-300x164.jpg 300w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/50-374x205.jpg 374w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/50-800x438.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 989px) 100vw, 989px" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a tribute for Lamborghini by Lamborghini itself. A toast to all their insanity, a treasure to look back and realise that there really is no other company that can possibly go this berserk.<br />
Almost 25 years back the Countach was a misfit in the automotive world but was one of the most influential cars that defined the wedge shaped design of the 70&#8217;s in the automotive world and LITERALLY set a trend.<br />
Here we are now  25 years later, with the Lamborghini Egoista, oblivious to the fact that it will continue setting the trend in terms of design language and technology for the next quarter of the century.</p>
<p>You can choose to continue living your life and regard this as another impossible dream. A land that one can never reach. But if you really are the Lambophile that you claim to be, then understanding this entire situation from their perspective would really restore you&#8217;re faith in the Italian company.</p>
<p>So if somebody tells you the Egoista is where Lamborghini really crossed the line between practicality and madness, then assure them that indeed it is a leper! An outcast! IT IS A CAR THAT OUR AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY DESERVES, BUT NOT THE ONE THAT NEEDS RIGHT NOW!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Today&#8217;s topic</span></strong>: On why the DELTAWING was TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE!</p>
<p>There are two problems with proposing a revolutionary idea in this vast engineering playground. Firstly, there aren&#8217;t any! Before you could even begin to ink the idea as a result of your lucid dreaming, some bloke from another land would&#8217;ve already accomplished what you wanted to.</p>
<p>Secondly, and this is the more itchy one- As society, our reflex tells us to completely ridicule any sign of ingenuity when it presents itself through the eyes of a visionary. Naming the likes of Leonardo Davinci, Wright brothers, Marie Curey, justifies what I&#8217;m trying to say.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the society that I actively try to be a part of has foolishly continued the trend and discarded what could have been a potential revolution in terms of design, fuel efficiency and more importantly- Motorsports.</p>
<p>Nissan have no longer decided to take part in Ben Bowlby&#8217;s DELTAWING endeavor as engine supplier. Michelin, the tire company that made bespoke 4 inch (<em>YES! only 4&#8243;)</em> thick front tires <strong>only</strong> for the Deltawing, have also fled from the scene. The project has hit the road block and they have officially opted out from this monumental project. Now there no longer will be a &#8220;bat mobile&#8221; on the grids of this year&#8217;s various American Le Mans(ALMS) events.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s more than just the visually radical car that we are going to miss now, aren&#8217;t we? If you&#8217;ve read my <a href="http://autospace.co/nissan-deltawing-the-tipping-point-of-motorsport-cars/" target="_blank">post on the Deltawing</a>, my enthusiasm bubbling through the article about it&#8217;s conceptual design philosophy and overcoming its engineering challenges is proof enough that I for one was in full support of this act. Like many others I believed in Deltawing, and like many others, I too have been deceived.</p>
<p>But who&#8217;s to blame, you ask? Well of course the various motorsport organisations that govern the rules and regulations and run the races every year. If you&#8217;ve been following the motorsport planet closely then you&#8217;ll know that this isn&#8217;t the first time an avant-garde concept like this has been severed.</p>
<div id="attachment_5079" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/brabham-bt468.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5079" class="size-medium wp-image-5079" src="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/brabham-bt468-300x209.jpg" alt="More popularly known as &quot;Fancar&quot;!" width="300" height="209" srcset="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/brabham-bt468-300x209.jpg 300w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/brabham-bt468-374x260.jpg 374w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/brabham-bt468.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-5079" class="wp-caption-text">More popularly known as &#8220;Fancar&#8221;!</p></div>
<p>The Brabham BT46, a true contender back in its prime F1 days, had an unbelievably perfect success rate. It won all the races it ever took part in. But the history books will hide the fact it had a lifespan as that of a month. A large fan placed near the rear diffuser (intended for engine cooling purposes) apparently sucked in so much air from beneath the car, that the enormous ground effect created so much downforce compared to other cars on the grid that it won on its debut. Even though none of the rules at the time were broken, the FIA swallowed this bitter truth as a biased racing form than outright genius and hence banned it! Since then, the BT46 never saw the light of day ever again.</p>
<p><a href="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/p34.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5081" src="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/p34-300x200.jpg" alt="p34" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/p34-300x200.jpg 300w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/p34-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/p34-374x249.jpg 374w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/p34-800x533.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Various racing teams have a cheeky way of working around the rules that govern the designing of the car. It really depends on how you perceive the regulations. So back in 1978, Tyrell showcased the world what formula1 historians call as &#8220;the most recognizable design in the history of world motorsports&#8221;. In order to increase the frontal downforce, the Tyrell P34 had <strong>four</strong> wheels on the front axles and two on the rear. This increased the contact patch on the front axles, hence giving a tighter grip compared to any other team back in the day. The design was such a success that FIA re-amended the rule that &#8220;FOUR is the maximum number of wheels allowed&#8221;. Talk about hypocrisy!</p>
<p><a href="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/newey-and-his-EBD.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5082" src="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/newey-and-his-EBD-300x200.jpg" alt="newey-and-his-EBD" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/newey-and-his-EBD-300x200.jpg 300w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/newey-and-his-EBD.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>The most recent incidence we can all relate to was in the 2011 F1 season with Adrian Newey. For some reason, we at Autospace cant stop loving him. His <a href="http://www.formula1-dictionary.net/diffuser_blown.html" target="_blank">exhaust blown diffuser</a> (EBD) concept single handedly propelled RED BULL racing team to partial championship victory half way through the season itself. The FIA once again played as wet blanket and ruled out EBDs the following season, only to stimulate an &#8220;overall competitive environment&#8221; and to increase TV viewership.</p>
<p>So why is the Deltawing a victim, then? The same reason why the previous cars mentioned here were given the axe. Rear wheel steering, almost negligible frontal area, using only half the engine power, enduring only half the drag, doubling the fuel economy (so as to have fewer runs into the pit lane) and still being able to clock in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">same</span> lap times as that of Toyota TS030 hybrid or the Audi R18 hybrid and other already established Le Mans cars is TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So another one bites the dust. The world failed to recognize the limitless opportunities that could have progressed through the pioneering work of Ben Bowlby and his creation and once again we are on the losing side. One cannot summarize &#8220;The good, the bad and the ugly&#8221; of the Deltawing project solely because the Deltawing&#8217;s fight was indeed an ugly one.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But this sad story may have a happy ending. Good innovations die hard and something tells me  Mr. Bowlby isn&#8217;t done with the world just yet!</p>
<p>P.S- Give this guy some love. Visit his website and be AMAZED! (<a title="Alias Guy" href="http://aliasguy.com" target="_blank">http://aliasguy.com/</a>)<em id="__mceDel"><em id="__mceDel"></em></em></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The conflict between designers and engineers has always been a rough one. A car designer&#8217;s ground shaking idea almost always contradicts with an engineer&#8217;s definitive principles. In very few cases have both their minds coherently worked towards achieving the same motive without getting their hands dirty.</p>
<div>Jump to the video below and you get the feeling that Toyota&#8217;s design department worked covertly on a project that wanted to  revolutionize the future of mobility and the way we perceive an automobile in 2043.<br />
You have a car that changes colors through the owner&#8217;s smartphone app, responds to the owner when one&#8217;s walking towards it in a parking lot etc. All of which is really amazing.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>But there is one slight problem. Watching the video you&#8217;d get the feeling that the designers chose to keep their engineers out of their project only because it wouldn&#8217;t be half as practical as shown. And like any other engineer on seeing this, I thought to myself that THE AUTOMOBILE was that one last mechanical creation that performed only what it was actually built for, and that is driving from point A to B&#8230;until now! &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Machine_That_Changed_the_World_(book)">The machine that changed the world</a>&#8221; is painfully treading the digital footsteps of those of a mobile phone or a wrist watch, that perform million other tasks than what is fundamentally required.</div>
<div></div>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZOAC_sPCWME?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<div>But then again, I got to admit. It is a darn good insight on what the future holds in terms of mobility, transportation and traffic management.</div>
<div>So, good work Toyota. Now you only need to get <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIMO">ASIMO</a> driving that and you&#8217;ve perfected the art of automotive clairvoyance!</div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the world of Formula 1, there are only two things that exist since it’s inception back in 1946- Ferrari, and powerful rivalry. Rivalry- Now don’t be mistaken for a moment that Formula 1 speaks highly about healthy competition and sets itself as a sparkling example of spirit, hope, strength and friendship. NO! The latter is spoken about only in hush whispers. Competition is only skin deep. Rivalry and enmity, now that’s the cream that goes down the history books more often than success stories, vicariously that we all like to live. After all, “The evil that men do lives on.”</p>
<p>Formula 1 has witnessed so many iconic figures that have come and gone over the past half century. They’re mainly known for some of their heroic drives, act of humility, arrogance, national pride, and sometimes even for their tragic death on the track. Some find themselves known for their notorious behaviour or act of unsportsmanship, and it isn&#8217;t that all of this goes unnoticed by FIA or the crowd. It’s just that there is this common unspoken agreement among all of us that be it a dirty trick or harsh war of words, the rivalry between drivers before and on the race gets a hell lot more interesting than the usual Romain Grosjean crashing into at least three drivers at the first turn of every race and frustrating drivers around him.</p>
<div id="attachment_5057" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/marko.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5057" class="size-medium wp-image-5057" src="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/marko-300x245.jpg" alt="“If he (Alonso) says he is fighting with blunt weapons, then I think he really is whining on a very high level,” insisted Marko." width="300" height="245" srcset="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/marko-300x245.jpg 300w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/marko-374x306.jpg 374w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/marko.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-5057" class="wp-caption-text">“If he (Alonso) says he is fighting with blunt weapons, then I think he really is whining on a very high level,” insisted Marko.</p></div>
<p>I bring light on to this subject because I happen to notice a certain unrest between Ferrari and Red Bull as I was looking back on 2012 season. Back in the heat of this season, Fernando Alonso happened to mention that Ferrari aren’t fighting just Vettel but Adrian Newey too. A bold statement which could be argued upon but whether his intentions were to praise Newey’s technical brilliance and overall Red Bull’s understanding and translation of the F1 rule book OR to make Vettel conscious of his driving abilities and his fighting spirit if he ever starts from below the front two grids, no one knows.<br />
Lewis Hamilton picks up the baton from there and supports Alonso in the press conference at the Indian Grand Prix that ‘Nando is the more “deserving” contender for the championship and that Vettel is “lucky” to have a good car for 3 seasons back to back. Now that certainly would dent Vettel’s confidence.</p>
<p>But is it fair for both these drivers to complain and taunt Vettel, all in the desperate attempt to cause his downfall?<br />
After doing some background research, I can safely say that the above controversy isn’t<strong> new</strong> in its least sense. All year, every year there are such stark examples, some that stand out.</p>
<p>Juan Manuel Fangio once was introduced to a very sensuous French actress on qualifying day at Monaco. On the previous night of the race, he got an envelope with her room number and key of the hotel room she was waiting for him. Fangio, a hardworking man knew that someone was trying to sabotage his race the next day by giving him little or no rest and hence rejected the offer. The next day, Fangio went on to win the race and the distress on the French actress’ face was evident when he took lead.</p>
<div id="attachment_5058" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Dale-Earnhardt-23.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5058" class="size-medium wp-image-5058" src="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Dale-Earnhardt-23-300x255.jpg" alt="Dale’s very “intimidating” look." width="300" height="255" srcset="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Dale-Earnhardt-23-300x255.jpg 300w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Dale-Earnhardt-23-374x318.jpg 374w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Dale-Earnhardt-23.jpg 550w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-5058" class="wp-caption-text">Dale’s very “intimidating” look.</p></div>
<p>In one of Martin Brundle’s recent interviews he talks about his encounter with Dale Earnhardt or “The intimidator”. In the 1988 NASCAR Championship, Brundle recalls that Dale had spoken only 6 words to him in the entire season. The first two were “good job” when he won in Cleveland. Then when he was walking to his car sitting at pole, he passed by Dale’s car. If Brundle had won the race he’d be crowned champion. As Dale understood the gravity of destabalising the mental state of racecar drivers, he spoke the rest of the four words to Brundle as he passed him- “Don’t Forget your kids!”</p>
<p>As expected, Brundle threw himself away when Dale pounced on him on the first corner from nowhere and he finished 10th. Earnhardt went on to win the race and the championship. Brundle finally learnt that Dale Earnhardt was indeed given an appropriate nickname.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the immortal great Sir Stirling Moss was a subtle bluffmaster. He mentions in his biography that at times when rain was expected before a Grand Prix, He’d rub his hands in anticipation making drivers feel that he called for this and was waiting for it. But truth was, he dreaded the downpour as much as any other driver did on a given rainy day.<br />
On sunny days Sir Moss would have another trick up his sleeve. In 1961 Monaco GP, he goes at the back of Phil Hill’s car and just shakes his head in shame. “Old Phil was always a bit edgy before the start, and I thought it might wind him up a bit”, he laughs. He’d call this a psychological advantage and he understood and knew the other drivers better than anybody else on the grid. If all the drivers were to ever play a game of poker, I’d suspect Stirling Moss would win.</p>
<p>The most famous incident easy to recall would be that rift between Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher in 1992 French Grand Prix. As schumi takes down Senna on the first hairpin at the Adelaide turn, Senna retires while Michael has only a front wing damage and continues the race. But on the 11th lap as the race is red flagged, Senna grabs a word or three with Schumi teaching him a lesson about how wrong his manoeuvre was on him. His clever tactic worked on him and on the 20th lap, Schumacher collides with Stefano Modena on the very same hairpin and retires from the race too.</p>
<p>Nigel Roebuck’s research on this did inspire my interest and it astounds me to know the lengths to which some drivers can go just to get on the right step of the podium. The more I read the more I understand that this teeth grinding rivalry through treachery and deceit between racecar drivers is diminishing. At the risk of sounding sadistic, it fills me with sorrow to realize that fact.<br />
So Vettel if you’re reading this, grow a moustache like Keke and fight back. <strong>Bring back the old dog fights</strong>!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At many levels, the job of a critic is quite simple. It is easy to toss away the hard work put in by someone by a few negative remarks. In the world of motorsports, a certain similar trend follows too. Many regard motor racing as an &#8220;expensive entertainment&#8221;. The concept of cars running in a loop around a track seems unnecessary to the unpassionate eye. There is a certain degree of uncomfortable gossip about motor racing committees surging in more money even as the world&#8217;s fuel resources are depleting.</p>
<div> But little is known to such people that it&#8217;s the technologies on the race car that are eventually incorporated on road cars, and once every 10 years something new always comes up that changes the ball game. This time, it&#8217;s the NISSAN DELTAWING. And I reckon this right here is the <strong>very revolution</strong> that motorsport will be adapting to in the coming years.</div>
<div></div>
<div>You look at this picture and then you think to yourself &#8211; Would batman&#8217;s race car look something similar when he had no villains to fight over the weekend? Or is it some sort of a tribute to the highly acclaimed SR 71 blackbird by the automotive world?</div>
<div>
<div></div>
<div>Even a worm would be able to tell the evident difference between the cars in the picture above. So, what do we have then-</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s triangular shape. So it looks like a black arrow darting through the Tarmac when compared to the very obvious looking Le Mans cars, similar to the Toyota seen in the back.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s got 4 inch wheels in the front separated by a distance of a staggering 15.6 inches only!! So that means its rear wheel steering. Right there, it takes me by surprise. Seriously, when was the last time you heard of a racecar that&#8217;s real wheel steered?</li>
<li>The angular front translates to lesser frontal area, meaning significantly reduced drag, therefore lesser fuel consumption and far lesser pitstops. And as we all know, in motor racing, that&#8217;s a lot of time saved.</li>
</ul>
<div>All of this adds to uniquity of this car. The designer of this mad machine is as crazy as you might have already perceived him to be. But there is more logic in his philosophy than his absurdity.</div>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>Ben Bowlby</strong>, the creator says- With half the weight, half the drag, half the power and half the fuel consumption, the Deltawing will race at the same speeds as a modern day Le Mans car.</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<div id="attachment_5019" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/dw3.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5019" class="size-medium wp-image-5019" src="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/dw3-300x237.jpg" alt="&quot;Racing is going to die if we can't capture the imagination of a new generation of motor-sports fans&quot;, says Bowlby." width="300" height="237" srcset="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/dw3-300x237.jpg 300w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/dw3-374x295.jpg 374w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/dw3.jpg 570w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-5019" class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Racing is going to die if we can&#8217;t capture the imagination of a new generation of motor-sports fans&#8221;, says Bowlby.</p></div>
<p>Getting to the interesting bit now (and proving my point), the specs- Power is developed via Nissan&#8217;s meager 1.6L turbocharged inline 4 pot, coupled with a 5   speed sequential manual &#8216;box. So it&#8217;s not what you&#8217;d call a power train that would deprive you from your sleep.</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But here&#8217;s the good part &#8211; chassis is based on an Aston Martin AMR tub, with <em>Recyclable Energy Absorbing Matrix System </em>(REAMS) body panels. This material  is a composite plastic made up of woven threads of polymers as basic as PVC. That makes it a lot more cheaper and lighter than the already well established material   in motor sports, carbon fiber.</div>
<blockquote>
<div>REAMS can block bullets, whereas carbon fiber shatters on impact.</div>
</blockquote>
<div>All of this means that the car weighs in at about 475 kilos (dry weight). If my basic math skills haven&#8217;t failed me as of yet, that&#8217;s an unbelievable 631 bhp per tonne. Bugatti engineers will be rueful of hearing that.</div>
<div></div>
<div> I mentioned that once every 10 years in motorsports a revelatory race car or race- inspired technology springs up. Elaborating, in the 1950&#8217;s engines were pushed from the front to the centre of the car for better weight distribution and dynamics. Then in the 60&#8217;s, cars with wings were among the first few weird creations in that decade. And 10 years later, the whole industry went berserk about ground effect and underwings cut into the bottom of the chassis producing more downforce. In the 80&#8217;s, Lightweight carbon fiber became a standard amongst all teams and the following decade gave rise to all sorts of electronic aid like traction control, adaptive suspension and all the hoolah that made even an ordinary driver compete wheel to wheel against a top notcher.</div>
<div></div>
<div>All of this did start to mess around the minds of engineers and aerodynamicists so much that racing really got dangerous. Sometimes even fatal-</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<div id="attachment_5022" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/senna.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5022" class="size-medium wp-image-5022" src="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/senna-300x225.jpg" alt="Ayrton Senna statue at Imola, Italy." width="300" height="225" srcset="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/senna-300x225.jpg 300w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/senna-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/senna-374x281.jpg 374w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/senna-800x600.jpg 800w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/senna.jpg 1032w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-5022" class="wp-caption-text">Ayrton Senna statue at Imola, Italy.</p></div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Make no mistake in capturing my point here that every breakthrough technology or wild concept in the last century as mentioned above has now become a routine implementation in our everyday road cars too.</div>
<div>The Deltawing then would be the most ingenious creation of our decade, not just automotive-ly speaking. Defying convention through every inch of it&#8217;s triangular body and within, I for one will not be surprised when cars will adopt the same philosophy or technology of this polarising racecar. So in the future if you happen to read about BMW or Peugeot revealing their flagship models in 2016 with REAMS body panels, then you where it came from.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Embracing wacky concepts as this will only result in the betterment of future mobility and a greater balance in life..and silence a few critics maybe. So here&#8217;s to those unconventionalists, like Bowlby and his team.</div>
<div></div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Today’s topic:</strong><strong> </strong>Sheer driving pleasure?</p>
<p>The tiring and endless saga to bridge the gap between what is real and what isn’t in the technology world finally seems to be getting somewhere. Software developers predict that soon you will be able to smell the aroma of a hot Mexican pasta while reading its recipe online. The gaming industry is making the experience so realistic for its gamers that it wouldn’t be surprising if one decides to randomly spray bullets in public imagining himself to be Captain Price of the Call of Duty franchise. Even the latest virtual personal assistant like Apple’s “Siri” seems to serve more than just its purpose for a few apple devotees, if you know what I mean.</p>
<div>
<p>Some people welcome such virtuosity with open arms while others are skeptical about it. Current automotive industry is equally entangled in wires and electronic gadgetry, some of which us enthusiasts have welcomed whole-heartedly. Like BMW’s living engine that can think for itself, and Google’s autonomous vehicles.</p>
<div>
<p>But off late there has been a similar bug that has crawled up from the dark into the automotive world. And most of us car lovers don’t really have our arms wide open for this new gadget.</p>
<div>I’m talking about the ugly-looking, engine noise producing device that has found its place in the cabin of your car. BMW, Audi and few others have begun incorporating this.Mostly in their electric power trains though.</div>
<div>
<p>So what exactly does it do? Well, it reverberates a pre-recorded (mind you again, IT IS pre-recorded) engine noise depending on the throttle position. So the harder you hit the pedal, the noisier it gets. But would one really want one?</p>
<p><a href="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/fake-engine-noise.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-191" src="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/fake-engine-noise.jpg" alt="fake-engine-noise" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/fake-engine-noise.jpg 300w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/fake-engine-noise-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<div>
<p>Reading this, you might have mixed reactions. But I’ll tell you what we feel about it in one word: REDUNDANT! RUBBISH! MOOD SPOILER! PLEASURE KILLER!</p>
<div>
<p>It is nothing but a sugar-coated pill. A velvet lie. To have that device lie to you about your engine’s grunt is like telling your friend you like Justin Bieber’s new song – people are just NOT going to buy that. It’s as unreal as a politician’s promise.</p>
<div>All this talk brings me to the 2012 BMW M5. Two big flaws by BMW on this once epic saloon &#8211;</div>
<div>1) they’ve firstly downgraded the engine to a turbocharged V8 from a beautiful V10. If you are wondering why, then ask any environmentalist and he’ll tell you.</div>
<div>
<p>2) Also and most importantly they’ve installed this fake engine roaring device in the passenger cabin to create a V10 like noise. And they thought we wouldn’t notice.</p>
<div id="attachment_192" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/bmw-m5.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-192" class="size-medium wp-image-192" src="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/bmw-m5-300x200.jpg" alt="BMW M5. Sheer driving pleasure?" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/bmw-m5-300x200.jpg 300w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/bmw-m5-374x249.jpg 374w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/bmw-m5.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-192" class="wp-caption-text">BMW M5. Sheer driving pleasure?</p></div>
<div>The very creation of this device began with solving the fundamental problem of electric cars being virtually noiseless, which increases the risk of being run over by an unnoticed, unheard vehicle.</div>
<div>
<p>But are you telling me that is the best solution our current generation of great minds of the automotive world could come up with?</p>
<div>
<p>Mercedes’ braking technology that hits the brake pedal automatically faster than the driver would at an emergency scenario using acceleration and pressure sensors ; Using thermal vision cameras at night to see beyond what human eyes can perceive to avoid collision ; not to mention ESP and traction control – one can easily come up with current, ready to be implemented technologies on the electric cars that will still give parents the assurance to let their children play out on the streets without having to worry about their kid run over by a silent <del>assassin</del> car.</p>
<div>
<p>Giving this a lot of thought, revelation dawned upon me when I was grieving about this technology to my fellow mates who share the same negativity about it as clearly expressed here. The problem isn’t that VW or Audi engineers aren’t thinking simple enough for the most simplest of solutions (I’d be the last person to underestimate their capabilities).</p>
<div>
<p>The problem lies with HOLLYWOOD…and all the other future visionaries of this world. Science fiction movies have deceived us into believing that the future world will look and sound like the ones depicted in “I,robot” and “The island” etc.</p>
<div>
<p>For those who have enjoyed the thrill of deafening engine roars bombarding your eardrums feel the pain of the arrival of this pseudo-musical instrument. But I’d rather have a noiseless car than being lied to me about my engine’s or motor’s firepower.</p>
<div>If you really want to be inspired by machines from sci-fi movies, then why not consider a practical BATPOD from “The Dark Knight” series? Now that’s what I’d call<strong>personal mobility</strong> at its best.</div>
<div></div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The time is 8am in Brescia,Italy. Augusto Turati, secretary of the national fascist party officially inaugurated it. 77 drivers battling head to head and at the end of 1628km, only 55 drivers made it to the finish line.</p>
<p>As the race commenced, Aymo Maggi, the local talented favorite, along with Bindo Maserati (one of the 5 Maserati brothers) took the lead in a ISOTTA FRASCHINI 8A SS, a luxury Italian carmaker back in its ripe days. But then just 30 minutes into the race and the ALFA ROMEO RL SS took a whopping 14 minute lead against the Isotta .</p>
<p>The ALFA even passed Fernando Minoia’s OM 123, an unparalleled legend of his time. After 587km, Brilli-Peri in his ALFA still held onto the lead averaging a 106.8kmph. But Peri stretched it too far and had to retire mid-way through due to a blown engine. This sent 25000 viewers ecstasic as they screamed louder than Minoia’s OM 123 as it swooshed past the overly-dominant ALFA.<br />
6 tyre changes, heavy competition from LAMBDAS of Strazza and even the Isotta of Maggi and after a gruesome 21hr 4min and 48s, averaging a 77.68kmph, Minoia’s victory made the Brescians go wild- literally showering flowers on the cars which overlooked the track and crowding around the OM to get a share of the victory lap with the Schumacher of their era.</p>
<p>If you’ve come this far reading my rather “exciting” commentary, (presumably at the edge of your seat) , then you just re-lived the 1st edition of the “THE WORLD’S GREATEST ROAD RACE”, MILLE MIGLIA!</p>
<p>MILLE MIGLIA, yes say it again and let your tongue roll (read as millay mi-leah). It sounds like a sensous Italian woman with a beautifully ribboned summer hat who’d smile at you endlessly while floating on a Gondola. Truth be told, the Italian language indeed is very smooth flowing.Anyway, the literal translation of the Mille Miglia is a “1000 miles”.</p>
<p>This 1k mile race is not around a purpose- built race track but rather across some of the most serpentine and scenic “autostradas” Italia has to offer. The drivers have no pit crew, no team radio, no fancy traction control or even safety barricades at the cliff edges. Also noteworthy is that this is one of those very few races in the world where the drivers can experience a large spectrum of nature’s uncertainty – from rain to clear skies in one part  to dense fog and even snow in the latter part of the race, it takes a huge toll on the engine and more importantly the driver.<br />
Point A and B typically are two Italian cities and the race involves travelling back to point A without tracing back one’s path.</p>
<p>As on public roads, you’ll even find usual traffic flow as the race unfolds, and as there are no grandstands to view it from, the crowd peeks into the race action live from ground level, literally narrowing down the width of the road for the driver to drive on, just to get a closer look.<a href="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/1000_Miglia_map-01a.jpg"><br />
</a></p>
<p><a href="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1000_Miglia_map-01a.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-133" src="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1000_Miglia_map-01a-300x237.jpg" alt="1000_Miglia_map-01a" width="300" height="237" srcset="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1000_Miglia_map-01a-300x237.jpg 300w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1000_Miglia_map-01a-374x296.jpg 374w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1000_Miglia_map-01a.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>A vivid Mille Miglia follower in a documentary said that it’s not the car sliding off the cliff or crashing into the traffic that’s frightening, but rather the children that may suddenly run across the street around a blind corner or the fans getting closer to the race cars that comes of as a real threat to a driver.<br />
But the inevitable happened in 1957, the 14th edition of race. <strong>Alfonso De Portega</strong>‘s left front tyre of his ferrari blew while doing a 240kmph, killing himself and his co-driver and 10 spectators. This lead to the Italian government banning all forms of motorsports on Italian public roads.</p>
<p>But the spirit for motor racing and the lust for “<em>bellissima</em>” cars would go undying, and so from 1977 onwards, the race was restored and re-named as MILLE MIGLIA RESTORICA. A lot of changes with respect to racing was made and drivers celebrate the classic history through parades. The race is stretched out for 3 days but the distance of race remains the same. This year’s Mille Miglia is held from May 17th to 20th in its rightful birthplace, Brescia.</p>
<p>So here’s my confession : Writing the article is a way of shedding my pain for not physically being where I yearn to be at this time of the year. The burning desire to witness the tradition of “sealing” the participant cars with a metal tab by the judges (which follows the traditional rites of the sealing ceremony) and hear those timeless classics roar in the heart of a country that’s passion for automobiles is understated. If you’re still blurry about what’s at stake here, let me just shed light on this year’s participant cars &#8211;<br />
Alfa Romeo, Bugatti, Austin, Bentley, Mercedes Benz, Fiat, Aston Martin, Lancia, BMW, Maserati, Jaguar, FERRARI..  The list is endless, and I just named the well-known ones. Of the 1355 participants requesting to enter the race, 384 of these will fight for glory. ( Well, not as hard-fought as the olden days because of environmental and safety protocols and all that boring routine government has to follow. My frustration on this subject was well depicted in my previous article so I’m not going to elaborate more )<br />
The most exciting part for me is this- the organizing committee decided to only select cars between the 1930 to 1952 age bracket, and that includes my personal favorite – The <strong>ALFA ROMEO DISCO VOLANTE</strong> ( #alfaromeo official also confirmed through instagram).<br />
Yes, you can drool in private now.</p>

<p>All in all, it’s an ultimate feast for all six senses and especially for the vintage car enthusiasts like myself. There’s something very raw about their power and functioning that breathes a fire in my belly. It’s a gathering for the true car lovers, for the true <em>ALFISTI</em>, for those who’ve grown up reading/dreaming about these classics and for the car-connoisseurs. In this side of the world, age is just a number. To emphasize on this, a few children couple of years back painted their perception of the Mille Miglia while at the race .(A subtle method for mums and dads to enjoy the event if you know what I mean) . One girl had this to say-<br />
“Today the town turned into a toy-shop. Noises, flags, songs and people out on their balcony. The Mille Miglia passes by and hearts are happy and beat stronger”.</p>
<p>Comprehending what a 10 year old girl perceives of this event, it made me feel like a child. I’m happy.</p>
