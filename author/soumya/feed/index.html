								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unveiled just 9 days ahead of the Paris motor show to be held on 27<sup>th</sup> September, 2012, McLaren P1 is here for you. Dripping with McLaren’s eye popping orange, the P1’s official pictures just spread like wildfire all over the internet. The images clearly showcased the car after its teaser videos so far. Looks? My God that car is a beauty. With just a look of it, one can say the aesthetics of a mp4-12c purely studded in it, just an evolved MP4-12C to brief it up.</p>
<p>The powertrain has yet not been confirmed but the current speculations infer the same 3.8 litre twin turbo V8 engine as in the mp4-12c, but a little tweaked one producing an enormous 803 bhp. Adding to it is a fully functional KERS unit producing 160 bhp to a total 963 bhp. This is utterly hyper-car territory.  The unique claim by McLaren in this one was “the best aerodynamics”. The aerodynamic features include the dynamic new underbody diffusers, wide front splitters, winglets all over the side panels and rearward roof air intakes. Similar to the MP4-12C, this has retractable rear wings which work only during air brake necessity. An engineer at McLaren spoke out “every molecule of air that touches this car has a job to do”. A bold statement indeed, I will say.</p>
<p>Decided to go for sale from next spring, the so far called P1 will just have 500 units produced. Claimed to have a top speed of 239 mph and a 0-60 mph in 2.8 seconds, this is bloody fast. Who knows, as the previous  F1, McLaren might be limiting the P1’s top speed. Weighing about 2693 lbs, it gives a staggering 2.81 pounds per horsepower. Comparing Aventador’s 5.02, Enzo’s 4.56, Veyron’s 4.16 and McLaren’s own F1’s 4.0 lbs per horsepower, the P1 really stands out. Uniquely unique are the side windows and windshields in this car.<br />
Made from pieces of vacuum formed acrylic similar to fighter jet cockpits, this saves 62% of weight compared to normal glass. P.S- Notice, there are no windshield wipers. This special acrylic is a true non-stick surface which rolls away water droplets hitting it. See, that’s called attention to details and McLaren’s answer to technological breakthroughs.</p>
<p>Hoping to just cause a wild stir around the world as the F1 had done 20 years back, the P1 is all set to be launched in the upcoming Paris motor show. All eyes are on the P1 right now. Fingers crossed. No vague responses like the McLaren X1 this time. Please!</p>

<p>Envisioned first in the last century and work started by a Wisconsin based blacksmith, a four-wheel drive car has become a necessity for many vehicles we see today. Harry Armenius Miller and Harry Ferguson both believed that their development would be popular in the future.<br />
The first 4WD car was built in 1903, but it wasn’t until the early 1980’s that this unique concept came into series production. Many road cars such as the Jensen FF, Cisitalia 47 and the early 70’s prototypes of Formula one cars used this concept. But the manufacturer which had immense faith in the concept and wanted to make it an integral part of it production range was Audi with its Quattro model. The Quattro received proper attention to details and investment in research and development and marketing back up too, which boosted its early career as an unique vehicle package.<br />
Harry Ferguson, a man ahead of his times in the 50’s undertook the task of convincing the petrolheads around the world about the advantages of all-wheel drive for road cars, which he believed increased the safety and efficiency. And yes it did. People were attracted but give a thought to it after knowing about the concept. Ferguson started building prototypes of a sedan with four wheel drive system and all independent suspension.<br />
Engine mounted at the front with semi-automatic transmission and Dunlop’s Maxaret anti-skid system brakes. In 1965, Jensen went into production with the Interceptor FF, a car working on Ferguson’s technology, using an uneven torque split of 63% rear and 37% front. FF (Ferguson Formula) Developments, a British firm in 1972 built 2 prototypes for Fiat which weren’t an instant hit, but with passing of time they used the principal of the epicyclic differential for both the Lancia Delta Turbo 4 x 4 and the Fiat Panda 4 x 4.</p>
<p>The mechanical complexity of a 4WD system was designed to extract the maximum from a car, which it did. The unique concept of Ferguson showed that there was almost no limit to the search for perfection in a four-wheel drive configuration.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Oh GOD! Do the doors open up like this!! ??”. Yes, there is no door knob on this machine. Here you go, staring at this year’s one of the “what the hell!! My jaw is paining looking at it” car. Either you hate it or just fall in love with it. The MP4-12C is the second production car of McLaren after the F1. Launched in 2011 with the other biggies like the Ferrari 458 Italia and 2011 Nissan GT-R, this car claimed the critics for a rethink as to “Is this the most technologically advanced car ever produced?”.</p>
<p>Featuring a carbon fibre composite chassis fitted with a mid-mounted 3.8 L V8 twin turbo engine producing  592 horses at 601 N-m torque. Stuffed with F1 technologies, McLaren wanted something immensely fast. Learning from mistakes and experience from it F1 team, the MP4-12C became one of a kind. I mean what do you expect from a super with no door knob but instilled with sensors to open them.Just swipe ur palm over the body panel to raise the mighty and dominating butterfly doors. YouTube “How to open doors in a MP4-12C” to know better. I won’t go into the technicality of this machine but with my recent experiences, I want to just express how it feels when u just stamp ur butt inside it. Firstly, it smells good and all the parts are just at the right places. ITS NOT OVER DONE.</p>
<p>Just 3 AC vents dominating looks and doing their jobs just right. There’s no additional load given to the steering, the steering wheel is just what it is made for. Simple and sophisticated. The seats feel comfy and the controls are exact. The iPad sort of navigation and infotainment touch screen right at the centre of the console is just perfect and doesn&#8217;t irritate by the typical voice commands and controls. Everything in this car seems to be at their places for a purpose.</p>
<p>Personally, its just as beautiful on the outside as it can be on the inside. McLaren&#8217;s dedication and vision of making cars very technically has paid off with this masterpiece and we expect a lot of new breathtaking line ups from them in the future. Let me tell you a secret : “McLaren has a lot of empty space in their production facility, I think something F1ish is going to happen” !</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the years there have been many pretty cars but Enzo Ferrari said this “the most beautiful car ever made! “.</p>
<p>Her fans just kiss it, hug it, cuddle it and give all their gleamy teary eyes to her adorable and “can’t express it in words” looks. She was planned after the glorious records of the Jaguar D-Type at the 24 Hours of Le Mans race. Head and founder of Jaguar motors, Sir William Lyons wanted something very special which could be the successor for the D-type as a road car. Hired for it was the most respectable and ingenious vehicle aerodynamicist, Sir Malcolm Sayer. Sayer was asked by Lyons to build a road version of the D-type. With his genius mind and full potential, Sayer set for the making of a car which made history and still is making people numb just by seeing it.</p>
<div id="attachment_124" style="width: 246px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Malcolm-Sayer72.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-124" class="size-medium wp-image-124" src="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Malcolm-Sayer72-236x300.jpg" alt="Sir Malcolm Sayer" width="236" height="300" srcset="http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Malcolm-Sayer72-236x300.jpg 236w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Malcolm-Sayer72-374x476.jpg 374w, http://autospace.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Malcolm-Sayer72.jpg 390w" sizes="(max-width: 236px) 100vw, 236px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-124" class="wp-caption-text">Sir Malcolm Sayer</p></div>
<p>Built was a car which was outstanding in road performance due to the 3.8 litre six-cylinder Jaguar XK6 engine and aerodynamic quality out of this world. Sayer was a born genius and did things during his lifetime that none could achieve. He was God sent to use his insane brain, build, make history and return to him. The 60s never saw the use of advanced CAD technology but Sayer being a mathematician and artist, designed the E-type using mathematical calculations still unknown to mankind. Employees at jaguar are still unaware of his methods of design. On March 15, 1961 the world saw the evolution of the D with the E-type badge slapped on her back. Such was the response by automotive enthusiasts all over the world, it became an instant hit! Orders started flowing to jaguar which was unexpected for William Lyons as he didn’t much like the final product. Later in 1996, New York City Museum of Modern Art understood the significance of the E-type by adding a blue roadster to their permanent design collection. Lucky man!.</p>
<p>It was such a piece of beauty that still makes me all teary when I see her. You can never take your eyes off her. 51 years of reign for being the most exquisite piece of automotive art. This was the last piece of finest work by the hands of Malcolm Sayer. The 60s was a time in the automotive world which saw cars in their most beautiful form and the E-type was a part of it. Not only the looks that made the E-type a huge hit, but also the technicality and overall performance of her. Ian Callum, the present design director at jaguar still takes inspiration from the E-type for their future designs. The E gave such a bold statement that jaguar gets recognised by her. It’s a part of jaguar, their character, their soul.</p>
<p>I would literally repeat Sir Ian Callum’s words “Yeah! I can look at one all day long! ”. I am starting to feel numb now. I could just write about her for my entire life.</p>
<p>A small tribute by me to GOD’s favourite car!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“The car is fine. The problem is that you are able to drive only tractors and not a Ferrari”- Enzo Ferrari.</p>
<p>The world would have never seen a Lamborghini unless the Italian race car driver, entrepreneur and the founder of Ferrari S.p.A, Enzo Ferrari would have rudely commented on the repeated complaints of Italian industrialist and later the founder of Automobili Lamborghini, Ferruccio Lamborghini about his Ferrari’s clutch issues. This fuelled up Mr Lamborghini to start his own car company to show Ferrari, how supercars are built. The battle raged for 10 years since 1963 when both the companies came up with something which reflected their flexibility, creativity and passion. Ferrari launched its BB and Lamborghini showcased its Countach. Ever since the race for the most superior rear-mid engine supercar started and it still goes on till date.</p>
<p>Both powered by V12 engines with the Countach producing 375 PS and torque 356 N-m at 5000 rpm and the BB producing 349 PS and torque figures go to 409 N-m at 3900 rpm. Keeping aside the powertrain statistics, I would say “God! These two are utterly delicious and beautiful! “. Nothing could beat the maddening and demolishing looks and styling of Marcello Gandini designed Countach. Coz I still think it wasn’t a road car, it was a Batmobile. Ferrari continuing with its “beauty goes with the cues” character gave the BB a bold answer to Lamborghini. The rivalry heated up with people getting more inclined to the outrageous Countach and the BB still searching for some hope to sparkle among the public’s mind. But of no avail. Lamborghini’s extremely sophisticated first ever Scissor doors on the Countach added to the elegant style and technicality offered with it. This made Ferrari more desperate and they came up with the 512 BB, a more advanced than its predecessor 365 GT4 BB. Lamborghini still ecstatic with its creation continued with the Countach with some minor changes for 16 more years from its launch in 1974.</p>
<p>Italians hoisting the Ferrari logo flag with their national flag started to give a rethink. “Can Lamborghini replace Ferrari??” .The answer to this is still on top of the debate list. The passing away of the legends, Enzo Ferrari and Ferruccio Lamborghini in the 90s gave a huge hit to both the companies. Lamborghini lined up its next creations, the Diablo, Murcielago, Gallardo, Reventon, and Aventador. Ferrari too went with the Testarossa, F40, F50, F430, 458 Italia, California and the FF.Five decades passed and still the war is on. Lately for the 2012 Geneva motor show, I was really really keen to see what both of these come up with. Luckily the wait was worth it, Lamborghini came up with the most sophisticated, mouth-watering and immensely gorgeous one off Aventador J. Ferrari came up with the F12 Berlinetta boasting Ferrari’s most powerful V12 engine.</p>
<p>Enough said about the rivalry. For me both these share the equal number of Goosebumps am having now. Companies come and go, but none could ever replace the madness and craziness of Lamborghini, and the sophistication and beauty of Ferraris. I wish this war goes on till the world’s end and it will. They will never stop stealing our dreams and for sure will keep adorning our bedroom walls.</p>
<p>My special tribute to Lamborghini and Ferrari.</p>
<p>ALL HAIL THE LEGENDS!   \m/</p>
